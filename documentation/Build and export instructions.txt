There is a new issue with the VIPM that prevents it from using a network path in the "Build Output Directory". It isn't clear if there's something wrong with the .vipb file or this was broken in an update to the VIPM.

For now, the "Build Output Directory" is set to a "builds" folder directly adjacent to the "documentation" and "source" folders. Although a full path is listed in the .vipb file, this path is relative, so it remains correct between development and trunk branches.


After a successful build, please copy the .vip package file to the following location:
\\nirvana\Engineering_Services\Integration\exports\common\RT Management

If in the future, VIPM or this .vipb file is able to build to a network location, please update the "Build Output Directory" to be the above \\nirvana path.
